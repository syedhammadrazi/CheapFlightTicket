# Find The Cheapest Flight

- Final project for CS 102 - Data Structures & Algorithms.
- Team Members:
  - Huzaifah Tariq Ahmed - Designed the dataset & access.
  - Samiya Ali Zaidi - Designed the User Interface.
  - Syed Hammad Razi - Designed the logic for finding the cheapest ticket.
    
- Vision:
  - A simple application to find the cheapest available flights from the given dataset.

## Functionalities
- Finding Cheapest Flight(s)
  - This program converts the given dataset into a Graph ADT, and applies a Brute Force algorithm - inspired by Breadth First Search - to find the top 3 cheapest options available.

- Adding the Flights
  - Adds the given information into the Graph and then into the current dataset.

- Remove the Flights
  - Removes the given information from the Graph and the current dataset

## User Interface
- A simple GUI was made using the built-in Tkinter library in Python 3. The application accepts inputs through text-boxes and buttons. The output is also displayed on the screen.
